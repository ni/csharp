# Configuring Spelling Rules
By default, this package comes with a dictionary as acceptable spellings.

# Process

The analyzer works by looking through `CodeAnalysisDictionary.xml` [additional files](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/master/docs/analyzers/Using%20Additional%20Files.md). An additional file's contents will be parsed if the following conditions are true:


1. The filename is named:  `CodeAnalysisDictionary.xml`
2. The files are added to the build as an [additional file](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/master/docs/analyzers/Using%20Additional%20Files.md)
