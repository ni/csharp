# NI C# Style Guide

<!-- @TODO: Add the image once we get one -->

---

Welcome to NI's internal and external C# conventions and linter rules/plugins/tooling.

`ni-csharp` serves several purposes:

1. It contains our coding conventions/style guides for all C# code written for NI.
2. It contains custom Roslyn analyzers to enforce rules in our conventions that could not be found elsewhere.
3. It contains a package that can be consumed by a C# project to automatically configure coding conventions and analyzers.

## Written Conventions

TODO: Upload C# Coding Conventions

NOTE: Using the GitHub Pages link is preferable to a GitHub `/blob` link.

## Quickstart

Add a package reference to the package TODO_TBD.

```msbuild
<PackageReference Include="" Version="" />
```
